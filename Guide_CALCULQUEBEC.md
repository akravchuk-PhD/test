# Calcul Quebec Guide

### To setup:

1. Use sponser number (receive number by existing member) to create account
2. Receive approval
3. Sign-in and create usr and pssd

*Now that TFA is required, you must also do the following*

1. *Sign in to your online account using usr and pssd*
2. *Download the Duo Mobile App on your phone/tablet*
3. *Navigate to* **My Account** *>* **Multifactor Authentication Management**
4. *Register your phone/tablet through a QR code*

### To access the servers:

Open terminal/command line and type in somehting similar to the following:

```
> ssh -Y <USR>>@<MACHINE>
Pssd: <PSSD>
Duo two-factor login for akravchu

Enter a passcode or select one of the following options:

 1. Duo Push to <DEVICE>

Passcode or option (1-1): 
```

where `<USR>` is your username like `akravchu`, and `<MACHINE>` is something like `cedar.alliancecan.ca`. For more information on different machines, look at the links at the bottom of the guide. Use the Duo Mobile App to do the 2 Factor Authentication. 

Once signed in, navigate servers via command line (see: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line/modules/learn-the-command-line-navigation/cheatsheet). It is best to navigate to this directory to set up a github repository:

```
$ cd projects/def-jgnes/<USR>
```

### Installing packages

We want to set a module in which we will be working (as in, the versions of various programs we will be using). In order to explore modules, we can use:

```
$ module spider
```

We want to use the latest version of R available to us (4.4.0), so we find that:

```
$ module spider r/4.4.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  r: r/4.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

    Properties:
      Tools for development / Outils de développement

    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "r/4.4.0" module is available to load.

      StdEnv/2023

    Help:
      Description
      ===========
      R is a free software environment for statistical computing
       and graphics.


      More information
      ================
       - Homepage: https://www.r-project.org/

```

meaning that when we load, we need to run:

```
module load StdEnv/2023 r/4.4.0
```

HOWEVER for some packages of R, we will need the program gsl, which means we need to explore the modules for this program:

```
[akravchu@cedar1]$ module spider gsl/2.7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  gsl: gsl/2.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers. The library provides
      a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and
      least-squares fitting.

    Properties:
      Mathematical libraries / Bibliothèques mathématiques

    You will need to load all module(s) on any one of the lines below before the "gsl/2.7" module is available to load.

      StdEnv/2020  gcc/11.3.0
      StdEnv/2023  gcc/12.3
      StdEnv/2023  intel/2023.2.1

    This module provides the following extensions:

        (E)

which means we will ultimately need to load before every job:

```
$ module load StdEnv/2023 gcc/12.3 gsl/2.7 r/4.4.0
```

### Running jobs:

Once you have a file, let's say named `test.R` that you want to run, then create a `job.sh` file and run it using the command line:

```
$ sbatch job.sh
```

and check the progress of the job using 

```
$ sq
```

See `job.sh` for an example file running `test.R ` within R version 4.4.0.
